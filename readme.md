# Concerto Linter

This project is a part of my proposal for **Google Summer of Code 2025** under the **Accord Project** organization. The goal is to build a configurable linter for Concerto source files using **TypeScript** and **Spectral**, focused on validating the Concerto DSL syntax and its JSON AST.
